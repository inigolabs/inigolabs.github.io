## Introduction

Welcome to [Inigo](https://inigo.io).

If you're here, you've probably signed up for an account at [app.inigo.io](https://app.inigo.io) and are ready to start exploring how Inigo helps you manage GraphQL APIs.

Inigo blocks, modify, and enforce incoming queries before they hit your server.

Your first step is to explore the [Starwars Demo Playground](/tutorials_starwars_playground.html). Once you get the hang of it, it's time to apply your own configuration. Achieving both will grant you a master title - You are ready to add your own service and apply your own server configuration.

Let's start.
