## Introduction

Welcome to [Inigo](https://inigo.io).

If you're here, you've probably signed up for an account at [app.inigo.io](https://app.inigo.io) and are ready to start exploring how Inigo helps you manage GraphQL APIs.

Your first step is to explore the [Starwars Demo Playground](/tutorials_starwars_playground.html), once you get the hang of it, it's time to apply your own configuration. Achieving both will grant you a master title - You are ready to add your own service and apply your own server configuration.

Let's start.
