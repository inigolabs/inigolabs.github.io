## Prefilled Queries to Test

### missingOperationsName
By default, all queries must have an operation name. See what happens when it doesn't.

### maxDepth
By default, max depth was defined as 3. See what happens if a query passes that.

### maxHeight
By default, max height was defined as 9. See what happens if a query passes that.

### maxDirectives
By default, max directives were defined as 5. See what happens if a query passes that.

### invalidAccess
See what happens anonymous users try to access fields they don't have access to.

### hitMaxCredits
Rate limiting is defined by the number of returned objects per minute. See what happens if a query passes that.
